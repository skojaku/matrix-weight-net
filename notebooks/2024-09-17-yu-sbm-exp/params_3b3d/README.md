This is to store the paramters: 
- Rotation matrices of the three-block SBM - (1) from block 1 to 2 (S-01.npy), and (2) from block 2 to 3 (S-12.npy). Other rotation matrices can be obtained from these two, as in the code! 
- Nodes that have nonzero initial state values - (1) in block 1 (nodes-s1.npy), and (2) in block 2 (nodes-s2.npy). Nodes in block 3 all have zero inital states. 
- Nonzero initial state values set to nodes - (1) for the nodes in block 1 (y0-c1.npy), and (2) for the nodes in block 2 (y0-c2.npy).

The same parameters are set for both consensus dynamics and random walks.
